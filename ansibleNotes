Pre ansible setup requirments:

- "ansible" user on every node. 
- "ansible" user is sudoer and able to use sudo without passwords. 
- "ansible" user is able to ssh all control node to manage node without a password.
- ansible package installed on the control node.

1. on the controller node:

useradd -m ansible
passwd ansible

ssh-keygen 

cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub 


on the target node 
useradd -m ansible
and you can put the ansible user as the sudoer user by visudo

2. copy the public key from the controller node and paste it into the target node on .ssh/authorized_keys

on the target node execute below also:
 chmod 700 .ssh/
 chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
 # then you will be able to access the target node from controller node without password
 
3. to be able to ssh the target node without putting the ip address "Just the hostname" 

vi /etc/hosts/ 

then add the IP and the hostname on the target node such below:

127.0.0.1   ansible-controller localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
192.168.1.104	ansible-target1

 
----------------------
the inventory is responsible for adding all the hosts inside it.


you can test the connection with other servers by execute below command on the
ansible all -m ping 
# ping is a module to test the connection with other servers.
ansible all -m setup
# this command will show all the setup on the target nodes inside all host


Example let say that we want to get the logs from one of our target node and pulled them to the control node for backups or archiveing purposes 
lets say you want to do it as the file system level you will create a file that have a journalctl for the current boot which is include a lot usefull information. So we can do that by something called playbook, the way that you execute tasks in ansible is with modules but the module itself is just a tool that you can use and it typically part of a task and task is part of play just like below:

- playbook
  - play # inside the playbook we can spcifed multipul plays
    - task # the task has only contains one module
      - module
    - task 
      - module
  - play 
    - task
      - module
----------------------
play --> each instance of play plays are where you spcify which hosts you want to run something againts.        
task --> where you can configure conditionals such as i want only run this task if this host that im currently operating on is running xyz OS 
and sometime you can say that i want to run this task and i want to loop through it several times with different pieaces of input information.
----------------------
note: a playbook is a list of plays 
----------------------
shell module --> is used to run commands on shell environment
ansible-doc -s <name of the module> --> this will show you basic example of the used module.
fetch module--> is like the copy module but the fetch module can be works from the managed node not like the copy module

ansible-playbook ./logs.yml 
                  <playbook file>
